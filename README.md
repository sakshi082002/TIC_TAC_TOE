This project is a Tic Tac Toe game where players can challenge an AI opponent. Built using Python for the backend with the tkinter library for the GUI, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the game offers an interactive and engaging experience. The AI opponent leverages the Minimax algorithm to make strategic decisions, ensuring a challenging gameplay experience. The frontend handles player inputs and real-time game state updates, while the Python backend manages the game logic and AI operations. The game is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily engage with the AI, with real-time updates reflecting moves instantly. Cross-platform compatibility ensures the game can be run on multiple systems without extensive configuration. Players can start a game by running the main.py file and selecting their moves on the grid, with the AI automatically responding until the game concludes.
